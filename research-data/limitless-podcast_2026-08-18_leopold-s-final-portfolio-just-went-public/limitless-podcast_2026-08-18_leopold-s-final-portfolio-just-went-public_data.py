    "SK Hynix's record quarter and SanDisk's new 'high bandwidth flash' memory (backlogged into late 2027) argue the memory selloff was a leverage panic, not a demand top — all 2026 memory supply is already sold out.",
    "Berkshire, now run by Greg Abel, made a surprising $17B add to Alphabet — the quarter's single largest buy — on the thesis that Google is the only company that owns the entire AI stack, model to chip to distribution.",
    "Gavin Baker and Brad Gersner are running the most concentrated, forward-looking bets — Nvidia, Cerebras, SpaceX, and a 'power and optics' photonics trade (Coherent Corp, Astera Labs) — with Baker also holding a $2.3B QQQ-puts hedge.",
    "Nvidia's own 13F shows a circular-economy pattern: $30B in Intel, a big SpaceX stake, plus CoreWeave, Coherent, Nokia and Synopsys — companies that turn around and spend that capital on Nvidia GPUs.",
    "Consensus money is piling into Alphabet, Amazon, TSMC and SpaceX — but almost nobody in this batch of filings holds Nvidia directly, and Tesla is absent from every portfolio discussed.",
