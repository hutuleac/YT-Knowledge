    "Financial Times reports Anthropic is targeting a $2-3 trillion valuation for an October IPO — topping SpaceX's $1.7T record from a few months earlier and putting Anthropic among only five companies ever to touch $3T; investors expect ARR to hit $100-120B by year-end.",
    "New Ramp data on enterprise AI spend: 43.5% of US businesses paid Anthropic for subscriptions/tokens last month vs. 39.7% for OpenAI and just 6.2% for Google's AI tools — a reversal from 18 months ago when, as Jason puts it, 'people were like, what's Claude?'",
    "Jason's IPO-investing advice is consistent and blunt: don't buy at the open — IPOs get priced to perfection and pop, then fall back once institutions start buying (cites SpaceX, Figma, Instacart, Reddit) — better to slowly build a position over a 10-year window.",
    "Anthropic is also reportedly in talks to acquire Israeli chip-efficiency startup Decart AI for ~$6B, its largest deal to date; Jason reads it as a sign the M&A market has reopened after years in the wilderness, aided by a friendlier regulatory environment.",
    "Two founder interviews: Sammy Herabi of Wisewell pitches a subscription countertop water-purification device (with a microplastics/fertility health case behind it) that Jason is personally negotiating to invest in; Punit Puri of Grit Robotics explains how AI-trained, off-the-shelf robot arms are already installing solar panels 4-8x faster than human crews in Nevada.",
    "Friday's off-duty segment: a NYT/Google dataset on 2025 emoji trends, a DJI wireless mic recommendation for better LLM dictation, and picks for Ted Lasso season 4, HBO's Lanterns, Hulu's Furious, and AMC's The Shards.",
