    "Visser's standing thesis: compute demand is structurally insatiable, and this week brought concrete evidence — Apollo, BlackRock, Blackstone, Brookfield, Goldman Sachs and KKR launching AI infrastructure financing platforms to mobilize over $500B, Morgan Stanley committing to $1.5T more, Alphabet raising $25B, and Intel upsizing a stock offering to $20B.",
    "Nvidia's 2020-era A100 GPU is now contracted out to 2029 and completely sold out — the assumed useful life of a GPU generation has stretched from 2-3 years to 6-9 years because data center capacity can't keep up.",
    "Google's AI talent is reading a capital-allocation pivot as a downgrade: Jeff Dean and Demis Hassabis are both flagged as flight risks (per the All-In Podcast and Moonshots podcast), and Visser argues Google may be settling into an 'infrastructure landlord' role rather than winning the frontier-model race.",
    "SpaceX guided to 6-8 GW (possibly above 10 GW) of new data center capacity in 2027 alone on its first earnings call, with 80% earmarked for space-based data centers and an exclusive Nvidia Vera Rubin GPU deal.",
    "His concentrated AI portfolios are compounding well ahead of the index — the 10-name portfolio is up 94% YTD (103% equal-weighted) at an average forward PEG of just 0.8 — and he's releasing a prompt that scores his own conviction shifts from his weekly transcripts.",
    "New highest-conviction call: after physical compute, the next constraint is financial — stablecoins and tokenization for AI agents — with Figure's earnings and a Pompliano podcast appearance cited as early evidence.",
    "Macro thread built around a Louis Gave (Gavekal) note on the yen intervention: weak labor and inflation data argue against Fed hikes, and Visser is recommending the 'debasement trade' — gold, silver, and eventually Bitcoin.",
